About The Project
This project is an email sender application. It provides functionality to send emails programmatically, likely for notifications, confirmations, or other automated email needs within an application.

Built With
Spring Boot

Java

Getting Started
To get a local copy of this mail sender application up and running, follow these simple steps.

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher

Apache Maven (if you prefer to build manually, otherwise Spring Boot's embedded Maven wrapper will suffice)

Installation
Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/Pravin-Sonwane-2004/mail-sender.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd mail-sender

Build the project (optional, Spring Boot can run directly):

./mvnw clean install
# On Windows, use:
# mvnw clean install

Configure environment variables (for email credentials):

Create an application.properties or application.yml file in src/main/resources/ (if one doesn't exist or if you need to override default settings).

Add your email configuration, replacing placeholders:

# application.properties example
spring.mail.host=smtp.gmail.com # Or your SMTP host
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=your_email@example.com
spring.mail.password=your_email_password # Use app-specific passwords for Gmail
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.auth=true
spring.mail.properties.mail.smtp.starttls.enable=true

Note: For Gmail, you'll need to generate an App Password, as direct password login might be deprecated or blocked.

Usage
This application is likely intended to be run as a Spring Boot service, which can expose endpoints for sending emails or be integrated into a larger system.

To run the application:

./mvnw spring-boot:run
# On Windows, use:
# mvnw spring-boot:run

Once running, you would interact with it via its defined API endpoints (if any) or integrate its service methods into your Java code.

// Example of how to use the mail sending service (conceptual)
// This assumes a service like EmailService is available.

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private EmailService emailService; // Assuming you have an EmailService

    public void sendWelcomeEmail(String to, String subject, String body) {
        emailService.sendEmail(to, subject, body);
        System.out.println("Welcome email sent to " + to);
    }
}

Roadmap
See the open issues for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

[ ] Add support for sending emails with attachments.

[ ] Implement a REST API for triggering email sends.

[ ] Add logging and error handling improvements.

[ ] Enhance security for email credentials (e.g., using environment variables or a secret management system).
